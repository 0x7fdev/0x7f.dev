My name is Andrei C. and I'm an elixir freelancer, accountant, husband, and a dad. I love developing web applications and sites, and I've been online for 22 years, out of which I've been a developer for 11 years now.

Here you can follow both my engineering blog and my more personal musings and thoughts.
